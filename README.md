# Vx300sDigitalTwin
This is a Unity-Mujoco based Digital Twin system of the Interbotix vx300s 6 DOF robotic arm.
Goals of this projects are:
1. Create a 3d digital clone of the vx300s robot arm.
2. Manually control the robot movement in 3 position axis and 3 orientation axis.
3. Digital clone should move simultaneously in real-time with the real robotic arm.
4. Create a "Targets Trajectoy Recorder", a system that records the arm configuration when a user manually moves the real robot. 
5. While recording, Digital clone should move simultaneously in real-time with the real robotic arm.
6. PlayBack must be identical to the recorded scenario. An accuracy graph should be presented as a proof.
7. A user friendly Gui with option to display external camera and to output screen recording.
